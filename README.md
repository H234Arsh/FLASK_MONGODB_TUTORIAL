# FLASK_MONGODB_TUTORIAL
This project is a full-stack web application developed using Flask that demonstrates two core functionalities:
Frontend-Backend Separation
Data Handling with MongoDB Atlas and JSON API

ðŸ”§ Project Features
Frontend Server (frontend_app.py)
Hosts a form-based interface for users to submit their details (Name, Email, Age, Country). Upon successful submission, the user is redirected to a success.html page. Form data is sent to the backend via a POST request using JavaScript fetch().

Backend Server (backend_app.py)
Handles API requests. It exposes:

POST /submit route: Receives data from the frontend and stores it in MongoDB Atlas.
GET /api route: Reads a data.json file and returns it as a JSON response.

MongoDB Integration
Data submitted from the frontend is inserted securely into a MongoDB Atlas database using the pymongo library.

JSON API
The backend also serves a static JSON list via the /api endpoint, showcasing API response capabilities.
